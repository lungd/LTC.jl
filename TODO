Fix start-up time !!!
@time res1,model = traintest(10)
461.522541 seconds (743.05 M allocations: 45.819 GiB, 2.71% gc time, 2.66% compilation time)
~ 9:30 for sine-flux_MTK.jl with new session (< 10 sec for 10 iterations)
type instabilities ???




Zygote up (ChainRules)


Move scaling Mapper from NCPNet to (Fast)Chain ?
    keep the net "biological" (no mapping); for training where the input does not need any mapping (O2, chem input)?
    Better performance with batched element-wise mapping (x.*W.+b with ndims(x) > 2) ?

Finish Flux-compatibility and reset_state!

Remove ExternalInput and add vars to the most outer container system (Net() ATM) ?
map external input to destinations based on some user's Dict. (not randomly) ?
Make use of wiring.n_out (y[end-out, :] inside model call)
    maybe better: let the user define what the output is. like for the input mapping

Move for-loop to model function (m.(x), for xi in x) ?

Remove obsolete dependencies

Use whole input sequence for offline training ?
    easier to handle irregularly sampled data (missing values) ?
    solve from 0 to seq_length
    callback for changing some param based on input(t) or registered external input function

Change inits/bounds to physiological ranges (e.g. v from -100 to 100)
How/where to check if solution stays in physiological ranges to speed up optimization?
    Callback to check physiological ranges ?
    after the whole solution got computed ?

Use Unitful ?

"Big system" and EnsembleProblem for SDEs
    solve Big system containing batchize sytems N times to get some means ?

How to train for input?
    How does the input have to look like to get a system to produce a target output?
    inverse problem

How to add NN components to the MTK system (UDE) ??

Module based Nets/Systems ?
Multi-objective optimization
    e.g. target (train_y) and electrophysiological features of solution

Use package for parameters (get rid of e.g p_mapin = @view p[1 : mapin_pl])
Use metadata for initial values and bounds. how to set and use custom metadata to symbolics vars ??
